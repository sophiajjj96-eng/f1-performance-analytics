# F1 Performance Analytics
SQL-based performance evaluation model using 2000–2024 Formula 1 race data.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical Formula 1 race data to evaluate driver and constructor performance.
The goal was to simulate a real-world analytics workflow:
- Extract structured data
- Transform metrics using SQL
- Build performance KPIs
- Visualize results in Tableau

## Key Business Questions
- Which drivers consistently outperform their starting positions?
- Which constructors show the most variability?
- Who performs best in recent seasons?
- How does short-term momentum compare to long-term performance?

## Tools Used
- SQL (aggregation, GROUP BY, joins, performance metrics)
- Tableau (dashboard visualization)
- CSV structured race datasets
